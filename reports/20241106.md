### Last Week's Goals
1.Connect the frontend with the backend to enable recipe functionality.
2.Build a small dataset of images for common ingredients (e.g., eggs, tomatoes) to display alongside each inventory item. I will implement the logic to select an image based on the ingredient name and use a placeholder for items without a matching image.
### Progress and issues
1.Leslie and I did research and implemented two API calls. One API provides a URL to the recipe but lacks text directions.
The other API includes directions but requires additional steps to process the data. As a result, users can now search for recipes, mark them as favorites, and view their favorite recipes. However, there are a few issues:

There are several small issue with it though:
  (1)The API response is slow. Currently, I’m displaying 8-10 recipes, but we definitely want to show more. Loading all 
  recipes at once takes too long, so I’m considering implementing a lazy-loading feature as users scroll.
  (2)The current approach skips recipes with missing data, sometimes returning fewer results than requested. 
   Potential solutions:
   (i) Use a while loop to keep fetching recipes until the desired number is reached.
   (ii) Fetch a larger batch (e.g., 20 recipes) and filter to get the required number.
  (3)To address the slow API response, I plan to add an animation while recipes are loading. 
2.Completed the database setup and established the necessary connections.
### Next Week's Goals
do what I mentioned in the section above.
