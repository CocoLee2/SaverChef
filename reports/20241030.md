# 2. Individual Contributions
## Nancy Cui
### Last Week's Goals
1.Finish implementing other recipe-related pages, including the Recipe Home page, Search Recipe page, and My Favorite page.
2.Connect the frontend with the backend, specifically for the authentication part.
3.Continue working on figuring out how to set up notifications.
### Progress and issues
Successfully completed all tasks listed above.
The notification feature currently works only when the app or simulator is running; however, I expect it to function independently once the app is deployed as a standalone application.
Additionally, I outlined the data flow logic between the frontend and backend for recipe-related interactions.
### Next Week's Goals
1.Connect the frontend with the backend to enable recipe functionality.
2.Build a small dataset of images for common ingredients (e.g., eggs, tomatoes) to display alongside each inventory item. I will implement the logic to select an image based on the ingredient name and use a placeholder for items without a matching image.
