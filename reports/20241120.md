### Last Week's Goals
1.go through logic in inventory, except “share fridge” and "edit fridge name", 
because share is more complicated, and change fridge name has a relatively low priority
2.add more checks on item information 
3.deal with items that have been expired
4.connect the frontend with backend on inventory 
### Progress and issues
Pretty much have done everything mentioned before. The only issue I encountered with was the barcode scanner API issue. Noah has found a solution and he will fix later.
### Next Week's Goals
1.implement share_fridge and connect to the backend
2.implement edit_fridge_name and connect to the backend
3.implement refresh and connect to the backend
4.implement “make this recipe” function (hopefully I will finish before next Tuesday,
if not, I will do it during Thanksgiving break)
