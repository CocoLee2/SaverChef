# 2. Individual Contributions
## Nancy Cui
### Last Week's Goals
1.Learn how to use React Native and Expo.
2.Implement the general layout for the app.
3.Develop key pages, including the splash page, authentication pages, home page, profile page, etc.
4.Set up notifications
### Progress and issues
I successfully completed most of my goals, and I also implemented reusable components (InfoBox and CustomButton), 
which can be used across different parts of the app. However, I encountered some challenges with the notification setup, 
which was more complex than I anticipated. As a result, I temporarily moved past that and worked on implementing the ShowRecipe page, which displays recipe details in a structured format.
### Next Week's Goals
1.Finish implementing other recipe-related pages, including the Recipe Home page, Search Recipe page, and My Favorite page.
2.Connect the frontend with the backend, specifically for the authentication part.
3.Continue working on figuring out how to set up notifications.
