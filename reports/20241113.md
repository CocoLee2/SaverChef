### Last Week's Goals
1.create/import animation while loading 
2.deal with recipes with missing information
3.implemented lazy loading feature as users scroll to get more recipes
### Progress and issues
Besides completing all the goals I had the last week, I helped with the inventory part. Now fridges and inventory 
items are stored as "globle variables", making is much easier and smoother to connect to the barcode scanner
and also backend.
### Next Week's Goals
1.go through logic in inventory, except “share fridge” and "edit fridge name", 
because share is more complicated, and change fridge name has a relatively low priority
2.add more checks on item information 
3.deal with items that have been expired
4.connect the frontend with backend on inventory (expect the two features mentioned in 1)
